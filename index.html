        <!-- Verse 1 (Red) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--red">A hymn marches softly through a chapel,</span>
          <span class="line">the notes weaving around polished wood and floral pews,</span>
          <span class="line">and I, in my seat, feel the tug of two truths that refuse to reconcile.</span>
          <span class="line">I am taught love, the pure love of God,</span>
          <span class="line">an acceptance and equality that enfolds all of humanity, yet…</span>
          <span class="line line--red"><em>All?</em> Are you sure?</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 2 (Red) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line">I am reminded too of the lines drawn</span>
          <span class="line">in holy text, in temple ordinances,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">that once said black hands could not hold power,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">that still say sisters in faith only have power in shadow,</span>
          <span class="line">behind closed doors, lowered veils, and under males.</span>
          <span class="line line--red">Are they loved? Are you?</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 3 (Red) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line">Hagar and Sariah, Leah and Rachel,</span>
          <span class="line">the voices of women whisper across millennia:</span>
          <span class="line line--red">“I am bound, yet called blessed,</span>
          <span class="line">to carry children for a sister who will always love me less.</span>
          <span class="line">Promised blessings and protection, yet cast aside.”</span>
          <span class="line line--red">Is that what love is? Is that where it hides?</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 4 (White) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--white">In a place sworn to truth but built with some lies.</span>
          <span class="line">An affair or a command, an angel’s sword or just lust.</span>
          <span class="line line--white">Mistakes mixed with doctrine muddy the water.</span>
          <span class="line">Hate and confusion stain the halls and history.</span>
          <span class="line line--white">The prophet as the man, or the mouthpiece?</span>
          <span class="line">But isn’t love trust? How can I trust a Janus?</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 5 (White) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line">I dream of a justice that would allow my hands to act,</span>
          <span class="line line--white">but I hear a woman’s voice is soft in the halls of governance,</span>
          <span class="line">her place beneath, supporting, auxiliary, never even a link in the chain.</span>
          <span class="line line--white">An exaltation whose asterisk is always *with your husband.</span>
          <span class="line">Yet where am I in the promises he made?</span>
          <span class="line line--white">Words imply he is a King whether or not I stay.</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 6 (White) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--white">I still kneel, still pray, my faith a rope that stretches</span>
          <span class="line">between devotion and dissent, between hope and quiet despair.</span>
          <span class="line line--white">It is a strange devotion, a soft rebellion,</span>
          <span class="line">to believe in equality while inhabiting inequity,</span>
          <span class="line line--white">to cherish commandments while questioning the lineage of laws,</span>
          <span class="line">to love a church, a gospel, and grieve its silences.</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 7 (Mixed Red + White) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--white">I wonder at the God who commanded polygamy,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">who catalyzed rivalry between sisters,</span>
          <span class="line line--white">who allowed false tales of cursed skin and failed valiance on the tongues of His prophets,</span>
          <span class="line line--red">who declared faith intertwined with hierarchy,</span>
          <span class="line line--white">who hides a Mother, I long to meet.</span>
          <span class="line line--red">Is that equality? Is that all that is meant for me?</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 8 (Mixed Red + White) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line line--white">I feel the fire in myself and dare to hope it comes not with brimstone, but with aloe.</span>
          <span class="line line--red">Questions too deep to be mistaken as shallow.</span>
          <span class="line line--white">Holding on to the softness of the testimony of a child, but I fear.</span>
          <span class="line line--red">Is she strong enough to hold the weight my shelf bears?</span>
          <span class="line line--white">She must be for now, for what else can I do?</span>
          <span class="line line--red">We must keep trusting that the love is true.</span>
        </div>

        <!-- Verse 9 (Gold) -->
        <div class="stanza">
          <span class="line">So I live crushed in the weight of this contradiction, as Atlas of old,</span>
          <span class="line">the truths in my hands, dense and dripping with history.</span>
          <span class="line line--gold">I pray for wisdom, for courage, for clarity, for the day the stories of women and men,</span>
          <span class="line line--gold">of all races, of all callings, will resonate as equal echoes of divinity.</span>
          <span class="line">Until that day, as change drips slowly like wet sand in tapered glass,</span>
          <span class="line line--gold">I will wait in patience, for Love to answer the questions I ask.</span>

        of many colors (blood red, black, pale pint, gold, lilac) pointing towards the 
        figure kneeling in the center (made of much smaller brown tile shards) clutching 
        their head in sorrow or agony. The right side made of stained glass in earthy tones

      <p class="mosaic-description">Feeling torn between two dissonant ideas can bring on 
        feelings of anxiety, guilt, shame, stress, anger, confusion, and lonliness. Social
        pressures to "pick a side" only adds to the negative emotions. Cognitive dissonance
        can leave you feeling shattered and stuck between two impossible sides. Is it 
        possible to make something beautiful from the pain?
