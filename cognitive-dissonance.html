        <h2>Cognitive Dissonance</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; color: var(--cream-dark); opacity: 0.9;">
          Psychologists currently define cognitive dissonance as "a drive-like state of discomfort resulting from psychological 
          inconsistencies in people's thinking which motivates efforts to reduce or prevent it" (de Vries et al., 2023).
        </p>
        <p>
          Put simply, it's the feeling of discomfort and mental tension that comes when simultaneously holding on to 
          two conflicting beliefs, values, attitudes, actions, cognitions, or any combination of such.
          It is a strong motivator to make some sort of change in thinking or behavior.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; color: var(--cream-dark); opacity: 0.9;">
          It often shows up when a person realizes they've acted against their own values or made a choice that doesn't 
          fully match their reasoning (though feeling dissonance isn't the same thing as simply being hypocritical). 
          People can reduce this tension by changing their behavior, adjusting their beliefs, adding new justifications, 
          trivializing the conflict, or seeking confirming information (Lv et al., 2024; Celik & Ekici, 2024; Shrivastava 
          et al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2024; de Vries et al., 2025).

              As elaborated on in the poem, I've experienced cognitive dissonance because I have potent social justice <em>values</em>
              such as wanting equal rights and opportunities available for anyone regardless of race or gender, and often <em>act</em> to support
              such causes. Simultaneously, my <em>actions</em> and <em>beliefs</em> in actively participating in, and having a testimony of, a 
              church/gospel that has a very blatant history of racism and whose entire structure of power segregates position and authority by gender. 
              Those two apparently contradictory cognitions (social justice and conservitive christianity) have caused immense internal tension.

              A common real-life example of cognitive dissonance appears in the behavior of someone who sees themselves as fiscally responsible 
              because they “always shop the sales.” They hold a strong belief that careful bargain-hunting reflects discipline and good money 
              management, yet their actual behavior often involves buying far more than they actually want or need simply because the items 
              are discounted. Those two cognitions (the identity of being financially cautious and the reality of overspending in pursuit of 
              deals) directly conflict. To reduce that tension, they may justify the purchases as “smart savings,” focus on the percentage off 
              instead of the total cost (i.e. people who fall for black friday "deals"), or compare themselves favorably to people who pay full 
              price, even if those individuals ultimately spend less time and money overall.

                As shown through Anakin Skywalker's story in the Star Wars prequels, cognitive dissonance can also manifest when a person sees themselves 
                as loyal, principled, and committed to doing good, yet repeatedly acts in ways that violate those very values. Anakin believes in the Jedi 
                teachings of peace, restraint, and selflessness, but he is also driven by intense passion, fear of loss, and a desire for control. Those 
                two opposing cognitions (his identity as a dutiful Jedi and his desperate, consuming attachment to Padmé, and her overcoming her inevitable 
                death) create a deep internal conflict. That tension eventually pushes him to justify choices he once would have condemned, showing how 
                powerful dissonance can be when someone is trying to reconcile incompatible beliefs.

                In Hans Christian Andersen's The Little Mermaid, the protagonist (Ariel in the Disney version) experiences cognitive dissonance as she 
                tries to reconcile her love for her underwater world with her yearning for a human soul and a life beyond the sea (with Prince Eric in 
                the Disney version). She values loyalty to her family and the identity she has always known, yet she is pulled just as strongly toward 
                the human world and the prince who represents everything she longs for. Those conflicting beliefs (devotion to her home and the desire 
                for transformation, human connection, and eternal existence) create a persistent internal tension. That dissonance drives her to make 
                drastic, painful choices in an attempt to resolve the conflict between who she is expected to be and who she feels she is meant to become.

                This longitudinal study looked at whether cognitive dissonance could explain the connection between emotional 
                sensitivity and aggression in adolescents after experiencing peer rejection. The researchers focused on 
                students who were highly sensitive to rejection (meaning they felt anxious about being rejected and were 
                deeply hurt when it happened) but who also tended to interpret other people's ambiguous actions as harmless 
                (low hostile attribution bias). This mismatch created a kind of mental tug-of-war: their intense emotional 
                reaction (“I feel really hurt”) didn't line up with their rational interpretation (“they didn't mean any 
                harm”). That internal tension made some adolescents act out aggressively in response to the situation, almost 
                as an impulsive way to cope and restore emotional balance. The study found that high rejection sensitivity 
                predicted more reactive aggression specifically in those with low hostile attribution bias, supporting the 
                idea that this emotional-cognitive mismatch/dissonance can actually drive aggressive behavior.

                A mixed-method study explored how cognitive dissonance and distrust of sources affect engineers' use of 
                knowledge-sharing platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub. The researchers defined cognitive dissonance as 
                the uneasy feeling that comes from encountering conflicting technical advice. For example, when an engineer 
                working on a problem suddenly sees two opposite solutions, it creates a mental mismatch: their established 
                knowledge clashes with the new information, producing friction that pushes them to restore balance. The study 
                found that engineers responded in three main ways: they might ignore the conflicting advice, revert to a 
                familiar solution, or just leave the site altogether. Quantitative analysis showed a strong link between 
                high cognitive dissonance and distrust of the source, meaning engineers experiencing this tension were more 
                likely to dismiss new contributors and seek information that confirmed what they already believed. Overall, 
                the findings show that cognitive dissonance can trigger both defensive thinking and behavior changes as people 
                try to resolve the discomfort and regain psychological coherence.
